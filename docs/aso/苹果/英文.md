### 描述
Save anything you find online to Clipora via sharing or manual add. Clipora automatically generates a formatted document, captures a permanent snapshot of the page, and lets you manage your knowledge, bookmarks, snapshots, and offline reading—all in one place.

In today’s information‑rich world, we encounter valuable webpages, articles, and updates every day—but they’re scattered across apps and browser bookmarks, making them hard to organize and review. Do any of these sound familiar?

* **Scattered information**: Your saved content is spread across multiple apps and bookmarks, so you can’t build a coherent system.
* **Lost pages**: Original content gets deleted or moved, and your saved links break.
* **Reading distractions**: Ads and clutter prevent you from focusing on the core content.
* **Shallow engagement**: You can’t highlight or annotate in‑place, so insights never truly stick.

**Meet Clipora**—the all‑in‑one tool for webpage clipping, deep reading, annotation, and personal knowledge management. Build an organized, efficient knowledge base that’s all your own.

**Core Features**

1. **One‑tap Clipping & Permanent Snapshots**

    * **Easy capture**: Save full webpages with a single tap on desktop or mobile.
    * **Forever archives**: Every clip comes with an auto‑generated snapshot—if the live page disappears, your copy stays intact.
    * **Offline access**: Read your entire library anywhere, even without an internet connection.

2. **Immersive Reading & In‑place Annotation**

    * **Clean view**: Automatically strip out ads and clutter for a distraction‑free reading experience.
    * **Highlight & comment**: Mark up the original text just like a printed book—add highlights and notes that stay linked to the source.

3. **Smart AI‑Powered Productivity**

    * **Flexible organization**: Use folders and tags to build a personalized knowledge structure.
    * **Full‑text search**: Instantly find what you need across your entire archive.
    * **Cloud sync**: Keep your data up‑to‑date across phone, tablet, and desktop.
