# Clipora - Your Personal Web Knowledge Collection Assistant Documentation

You can save information you find on the internet to Clipora by sharing or adding it. Clipora will automatically generate a document from the web content and save a snapshot of the page. You can use Clipora to manage your knowledge, web bookmarks, and webpage snapshots.

In the age of information overload, we encounter a vast amount of valuable web pages, articles, and information daily. However, this information is scattered across various platforms, making it difficult to manage and review centrally. Do you face the following challenges?

*   **Scattered Information**: Interesting content is saved in different apps and browser bookmarks, making it hard to find and impossible to organize systematically.
*   **Content Loss**: Original web pages are deleted or become inaccessible, and important information is lost forever.
*   **Reading Distractions**: Too many ads and irrelevant elements on web pages prevent you from focusing on the core content.
*   **Lack of Depth**: The inability to highlight and take notes directly on the original text prevents knowledge from being internalized.

**Clipora** was created to solve these problems. It is a powerful tool that integrates web page collection, in-depth reading, highlighting, note-taking, and knowledge base management, designed to help you build your own organized and efficient personal knowledge system.
