# Clipora

## üìö Project Introduction

Clipora is a web bookmark management tool that automatically generates snapshots of web pages you want to bookmark through system sharing and saves these snapshots to your local storage. The commercial version also parses web articles into more reader-friendly Markdown documents.

### üìè This Project is Divided into Commercial and Open Source Versions

The difference between versions is that the open source version does not include server-side related functions.

- The open source version does not require login and directly jumps to the homepage.
- Does not include parsing web pages into Markdown documents.
- Does not include AI translation functionality.
- Does not include data synchronization functionality.
